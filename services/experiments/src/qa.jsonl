{"question": "Explain the theory of evolution by natural selection.", "answer": "The theory of evolution by natural selection, proposed by Charles Darwin, states that organisms evolve over time through a process where traits that enhance survival and reproduction become more common in successive generations. This occurs because individuals with favorable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those traits to their offspring."}
